# Information on Codes for Atari Games

The following codes use acronyms for easier identification and post-processing. These are given below:
1) Deep Q-Learning Agents (DQN)
- ACE.py = DQN using epsilon-greedy for Breakout
- ACEx.py = DQN using epsilon-greedy for Breakout, which loads a previous set of weights to allow continued training
- ADE.py = DQN using epsilon-greedy for Seaquest
- ADEx.py = DQN using epsilon-greedy for Seaquest, which loads a previous set of weights to allow continued training
2) Deep SARSA-Learning Agents (DSN)
- BCE.py = DSN using epsilon-greedy for Breakout
- BCEx.py = DSN using epsilon-greedy for Breakout, which loads a previous set of weights to allow continued training
- BDE.py = DSN using epsilon-greedy for Seaquest
- BDEx.py = DSN uusing epsilon-greedy for Seaquest, which loads a previous set of weights to allow continued training
